## üîç Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Debug Information Panel

**Raw Results Data Expander**
- Complete JSON response from category discovery
- API call details and response times
- Internal data structures and cache status
- Error logs and warning messages

**Common Issues and Solutions**

1. **"Categories Discovered: 0"**
   - Check debug panel for error messages
   - Verify OpenAI API key is set correctly
   - Ensure minimum product count (5+) is met
   - Check network connectivity for API calls

2. **Empty Pattern Visualizations**
   - Products may be too generic or similar
   - Try more diverse product names
   - Check pattern detection thresholds
   - Review product preprocessing results

3. **Knowledge Graph Not Displaying**
   - Graph may be empty if categories weren't discovered
   - Check that knowledge graph building completed
   - Verify NetworkX graph structure in debug panel
   - May need to refresh after successful discovery

4. **System Appears Stuck or Corrupted**
   - Use the "üîÑ Reset All System Knowledge" functionality
   - Clear all cached data and start fresh
   - Check the System Management section for file status
   - Use Quick Reset button for immediate clearing

- Aim for 15-50 products for optimal category discovery
- Ensure products represent your actual business catalog

### Process Optimization
- Start with smaller datasets for testing
- Use "Force Re-Discovery" sparingly to avoid API costs
- Monitor debug panel for optimization opportunities
- Cache results between sessions for efficiency

### Visualization Usage
