# üìä Bulk Upload Guide - Custom Category Explorer

## Overview

The Custom Category Explorer now supports bulk file uploads for both **category discovery** and **bulk classification**. This allows you to process hundreds or thousands of products at once using CSV or XLSX files.

## üöÄ New Features

### 1. Bulk Category Discovery
- Upload CSV/XLSX files to discover categories from your entire product catalog
- Automatically extract product names from any column
- Generate custom business-relevant categories from bulk data
- Download discovered categories as CSV for further analysis

### 2. Bulk Product Classification  
- Upload files to classify all products at once using discovered categories
- Real-time progress tracking with status updates
- Download classification results with confidence scores and reasoning
- Handle large datasets efficiently with error handling

## üìÅ File Format Requirements

### Supported File Types
- **CSV files** (`.csv`)
- **Microsoft Excel files** (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)

### File Structure
Your file should contain at least one column with product names. Other columns are optional but can provide additional context:

## üìä Sample Data

A sample CSV file is provided at `data/sample_products.csv` with the following structure:

```csv
Product Name,Description,Origin
Organic Avocados Large,Fresh Hass avocados from certified organic farms,Mexico
Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets,Wild-caught salmon fillets skin-on,Norway
...
```

You can use this file to test the bulk upload functionality.

## üéØ Best Practices

### File Preparation
- **Clean Data**: Remove empty rows and ensure product names are descriptive
- **Consistent Format**: Use consistent naming conventions across products
- **Sufficient Volume**: Provide at least 20-50 products for meaningful category discovery
- **Descriptive Names**: Include relevant details (origin, processing, size) in product names

### Column Selection
- Choose the most descriptive column containing full product names
- Combine multiple columns if needed before uploading
- Avoid columns with only codes or abbreviated names

### Performance Optimization
- **Large Files**: For files with 1000+ products, consider splitting into smaller batches
- **Processing Time**: Allow 2-3 seconds per product for classification
- **Memory Usage**: Close other applications when processing very large files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Troubleshooting

### File Size Limits
- **Recommended**: Up to 1000 products per file for optimal performance
- **Maximum**: System can handle larger files but processing time increases significantly

### Common Issues

**"Empty vocabulary after processing"**
- Your product names may be too generic or short
- Try using more descriptive product names
- Ensure minimum 5-10 products for discovery

**"Failed to classify product"**
- Individual product classification failures won't stop the batch
- Check the warning messages for specific products that failed
- Review failed products manually if needed

**File Upload Errors**
- Ensure file is in CSV or XLSX format
- Check that the file isn't corrupted or password-protected
- Refresh the page and try uploading again

### Performance Tips
- Use "Force Re-Discovery" sparingly as it rebuilds the entire category system
- Cache is preserved between sessions for faster subsequent runs
- Download results immediately after processing to avoid loss

## üìà Output Formats

### Category Discovery Results
- **Categories CSV**: Contains discovered category names, descriptions, sizes, and keywords
- **Hierarchy Display**: Visual representation of category relationships

### Classification Results  
- **Product Name**: Original product name from your file
- **Primary Category**: Best matching discovered category
- **Confidence**: Percentage confidence in the classification
- **Secondary Categories**: Alternative category matches
- **Reasoning**: AI explanation for the classification decision
